### ‚Ñπ Sandboxes ‚Ñπ
Sandboxing is useful when it comes to testing whether or not the tools contain malware, and it is *strongly* recommended to do so depending on the tool size.
| Name | Link | Description |
| :--- | ---- | ---: |
| AnyRun | [any.run](https://app.any.run/) | A (mostly) free online interactive VM/sandbox, one of the best out there, requires business e-mail, however limited to 5 minutes per sample including a 16MB sample size (Bypassable up to 100-300MB) for free tier accounts |
| TRIAGE | [tria.ge](https://tria.ge/) | A completely free online interactive VM/sandbox, less informative compared to AnyRun, however it needs just a singular log in using any email or even GitHub, with up to a 30-minute sample time limit and no sample size limit. |
| HybridAnalysis | [hybrid-analysis.com](https://hybrid-analysis.com/) | A completely (login-)free online sandbox, unlike the others it is not interactive, has a 100MB file size limit and has a very long queue to get your file analyzed. |
| JoeSandbox | [joesandbox.com](https://www.joesandbox.com/) | Appears to be a fully interactive online VM/sandbox with a 100MB file size limit, however I have never personally used it. |
| CUCKOO | [cuckoo.cert.ee](https://cuckoo.cert.ee/) | A non-interactive completely (login-)free online sandbox, appears to have no file size limit and I have rarely used it personally. |

# üìù Notes üìù
###### General
Most of these tools are obtained from [CyberArsenal](https://cyberarsenal.org/) and [xss.is](https://xss.is/), credits for the cracks go to them.<br><br>If an archive asks for a password, try `pwn3rzs`, `Pwn3rzs`, `xss.is`, `XSS.IS` or `exploit.in`

###### Cobalt Strike
Cobalt Strike **requires you** to deploy the teamserver on a Linux install such as Ubuntu, or whatever distro of your choice.<br>In order to run the Cobalt Strike client on your Windows install, you will have to run the following command:<br>`java -XX:ParallelGCThreads=4 -XX:+AggressiveHeap -XX:+UseParallelGC -Xms512M -Xmx1024M -jar cobaltstrike-client.jar`.

On Linux, you can simply run `start.sh`.

###### Brute-Ratel
I am not sure whether or not this version of Brute-Ratel works properly, it has not been tested at all, however from the few basic functions *I am assuming it works*. If it does not, someone let me know.

If Brute-Ratel fails to compile the badger.bin into a badger.exe you can use the following to manually compile it: `cat badger.bin | msfvenom -p - -f exe --platform win -a x64 -o badger.exe`

###### CraxsRat
This version of CraxsRAT appears to be quite unstable when it comes to connections, if someone wants me to, I can attempt to find a newer version of this rat.

###### Immunity CANVAS
Immunity CANVAS contains the following: `D2 Exploitation Pack v2.55` & `White Phosphorus v1.28`.

###### HCL AppScan
Upon installing AppScan make sure to **replace the installed DLLs with the cracked ones**.

###### JexBot v1.0
1. Run add_hosts.bat as administrator, if you get an "Access Denied" error, open "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" and add the following:
```
127.0.0.1 jex.tools
127.0.0.1 www.jex.tools
```
2. Run "Jex_crack.exe" and then open "JEX BOT.exe"
3. Put `mastercho` as the username and password and press login.
Note: After logging into the JexBot, you may close "Jex_crack.exe", however you will have to re-open "Jex_crack.exe" every time you want to open the JexBot.

###### Craxs RAT v6?
I am not sure if this is malware, as it is a remake of crax I've found on the xss.is forums going under "Anonymous V6", and it was also leaked according to OP.<br>Archive password: `suspicious`

Run strictly in a VM environment.
